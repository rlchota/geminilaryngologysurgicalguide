                    <li>The trach tube will be stitched into your neck for a few days until it is well healed. Once the trach is healed well enough, it will be changed. At this point it is usually safe to go home with the tracheostomy tube.</li>

You may feel some light tugging and pressure during the procedure but you should not feel pain.</p>
                <p>Your surgeon will make an incision in the front of your neck to get down to the cartilage of your voice box (“Adam’s apple”) and drill a hole through the cartilage so that an implant can be placed to push over the vocal cord. A flexible scope may be passed through your nose during the procedure. We keep you awake so we can position the implant perfectly and also test out your voice.</p>

                    <li>You can shower the day after surgery but do not submerge the incision in water for 4 weeks. Keep the area clean and dry (except for showering). Soap and water is usually sufficient.</li>
                    <li>Avoid lifting anything heavier than a milk jug for 2 weeks after surgery.</li>
                    <li>Your voice might became froggy and gravely a few hours after surgery and that may last a few weeks. This is normal, but you should notice that it is easier to get the voice out and project.</li>
